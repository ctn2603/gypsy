						After all these years they are still great. The pastas
						are delicious and garlicky. The price is still
						reasonable and the portions are generous. I'm glad they
						still give the garlic bread, my favorite to soak up
						their tasty sauces. It's a bit out of the way now that I
						don't attend Cal. But I still like going there when I
						want some pasta. There's a reason why they always have a
						line.

						I've been going here for years since 2014. Gypsy's is
						one of my favorite comfort food places to eat in
						Berkeley, a student area with many cheap but tasty
						places to eat.<br /><br />Large portions, fair prices,
						good quality. Lines can be crowded during dinner rush
						hours, but food usually comes out pretty fast. There's a
						dine-in area both inside and outside.<br /><br />I
						usually get my favorite- Frutti Di Mare (PACKED with
						seafood) and a Caesar salad. I usually experiment with a
						new alfredo dish as well, and have yet to be
						disappointed!.

						Wow!! Amazing pasta spot. No wait and they had tables
						inside and outside. A plate of pasta was $11 and
						portions were good! I ordered a shrimp alfredo pasta and
						it was very flavorful, shrimp was fresh, mushrooms and
						onions added were good too. Shrimp scampi was good too,
						but i generally like the thicker sauce pastas so I'd go
						with the alfredo. Garlic bread was soft, buttery, and
						had a slight crisp! The food took maybe 10 mins. Will
						definitely come back!.

						My favorite place. During my college days, I was always
						here. I love their frutti del mare and pasta pesto.
						Timeless place. As an older adult, I frequently come
						here. Menu and atmosphere is superb. Brings back
						nostalgia of my college days.

						Even now, years after graduation, I always think about
						Gypsy's and how good, delicious, and economical this
						place was (and still is). As a student, I would come
						here often to get an absolute barrage of calories that
						would keep me fueled throughout sleepless nights.<br /><br />Even
						now, when I'm still in the area, I still stop by to grab
						Godfather's favorite and other delicious goodies to
						bring back to SF.

						The Godfather's Favorite was my favorite! Kev and i took
						a random trip up to UC Berkeley for the night to try
						some yummy food places these colleges students go to and
						it did not disappoint!. The line is always long but it
						goes pretty fast i think. I love that the pans of creamy
						goodness is visible to all. Its truly freshly made and
						its cooked to perfection(The perfect post food after
						drinking next to a burrito of course haha) this little
						cute section you will find a bunch of other alternative
						to eat if you aren't feeling pasta which makes is that
						much more amazing bc if you're craving pasta and boba
						you can just head here bc it all in one place.<br /><br />The
						garlic bread it comes with was also cherry ontop, I love
						finishing my pasta with my garlic bread absorbing every
						last bit of that saucy goodness. When in Berkeley
						whether you go to school there or visiting you're not
						gonna wanna miss this! i definitely recommend trying
						this place out at least ones in your life.

						Ok, so I'm part Italian, and I went to Italy this year.
						I honestly missed Gypsy's creamy Alfredo sauce while I
						was there! Gypsy's pasta is so flavorful, creamy and
						delicious! I graduated from UC Berkeley, and still visit
						Berkeley soley for Gypsy's sometimes. Absolutely the
						best Italian food in the Bay! Must try!!

						Love the pasta here, and I always make sure to come by
						whenever the line isn't too long (which isn't very
						often). I love the Penne Gorgonzola here, which tastes
						absolutely amazing! It's the perfect place for dates and
						dinner with friends, and I would highly recommend this
						place for anyone craving pasta in Berkeley :))!
